    <h1 class="text-center">When should you use context API?</h1>

    <p>Here are some scenarios in which you might consider using the Context API:

        1-When you have data that needs to be shared between components at different levels of the component
        hierarchy.

        2-When you have a large number of components that need access to the same data.

        3-When you need to avoid passing props down through multiple levels of the component tree, which can
        lead to "prop drilling" and make your code harder to maintain.

        4-When you need to update the data in one place and have the changes reflected in all the components
        that use that data.

        5-When you want to keep the state of your application centralized and make it easier to manage.</p>

    <h1 class="text-center">What is Custom Hook in JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>A custom hook is a JavaScript function that utilizes one or more of the
        built-in React hooks (such as useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.) to provide a reusable piece
        of logic in a React application. Custom hooks allow you to abstract away complex logic and
        functionality into reusable functions that can be easily used across multiple components.

        Custom hooks follow a specific naming convention in React, where the name of the function starts
        with the word "use" (e.g. useCustomHook). This naming convention is important because it tells
        React that the function is a hook and should follow the rules of hooks.</p>

    <h1 class="text-center">What is useRef and useMemo?</h1>
    <p>useRef creates a mutable object that persists for the entire
        lifetime of the component, even when it re-renders. It is commonly used to store references
        to DOM elements, or to store mutable values that don't trigger a re-render when they change.
        useMemo is used to memoize a value, which means that it will only recompute the value when
        its dependencies have changed. This can be useful when you have a computationally expensive
        function that you only want to run when necessary.</p>
